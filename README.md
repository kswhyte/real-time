### Approach

In this project, the chief aim was to explore client-side security with Auth0 and build a real-time application with communications to WebSockets. When the server gets new information, it pushes it out to all of the connected clients, who each authorize with a github account. A user will come to the web app to create a poll/question for whatever audience of choice using 4 options/answers to go with it. Then a userâ€™s Github image will act as a marker to indicate when they have selected a poll option. All poll option selections update in real-time, and the poll 'admin' is able to specify an ending date and time.

### On the Server

This is a Node/Express application that starts off keeping all of the data in memory using local variables.
WebSockets are used to broadcast poll results to the client.

### On the Client

jQuery is used for all updating and DOM manipulations.
WebSockets are used to broadcast a user's vote to the server.
Auth0 is used to authorize the client with a Github account.
